I have seen some recommend high quality office chairs instead.I have not heard anyone mention secretlab chairs though, specifically the softweave fabric type. I think it looks very comfortable but who knows, I could be wrong. Would I be better off getting an office style chair? Any recommendations? Thanks",

I know when it comes to health it is wrong to go cheap but I have to. In my country monthly student loan is about $88. I can't go $300 for chair. I need your chair suggestions under $100. Thank you!
